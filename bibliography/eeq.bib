abstract={Large-scale simulations with complex electron interactions remain one of the greatest challenges for atomistic modelling. Although classical force fields often fail to describe the coupling between electronic states and ionic rearrangements, the more accurate ab initio molecular dynamics suffers from computational complexity that prevents long-time and large-scale simulations, which are essential to study technologically relevant phenomena. Here we present the Crystal Hamiltonian Graph Neural Network (CHGNet), a graph neural network-based machine-learning interatomic potential (MLIP) that models the universal potential energy surface. CHGNet is pretrained on the energies, forces, stresses and magnetic moments from the Materials Project Trajectory Dataset, which consists of over 10{\thinspace}years of density functional theory calculations of more than 1.5{\thinspace}million inorganic structures. The explicit inclusion of magnetic moments enables CHGNet to learn and accurately represent the orbital occupancy of electrons, enhancing its capability to describe both atomic and electronic degrees of freedom. We demonstrate several applications of CHGNet in solid-state materials, including charge-informed molecular dynamics in LixMnO2, the finite temperature phase diagram for LixFePO4 and Li diffusion in garnet conductors. We highlight the significance of charge information for capturing appropriate chemistry and provide insights into ionic systems with additional electronic degrees of freedom that cannot be observed by previous MLIPs.},

Tasks include predicting optical, thermal, electronic, thermodynamic, tensile, and elastic properties given a material's composition and/or crystal structure. The reference algorithm, Automatminer, is a highly-extensible, fully automated ML pipeline for predicting materials properties from materials primitives (such as composition and crystal structure) without user intervention or hyperparameter tuning. We test Automatminer on the Matbench test suite and compare its predictive power with state-of-the-art crystal graph neural networks and a traditional descriptor-based Random Forest model. We find Automatminer achieves the best performance on 8 of 13 tasks in the benchmark. We also show our test suite is capable of exposing predictive advantages of each algorithm---namely, that crystal graph methods appear to outperform traditional machine learning methods given {\textasciitilde}104 or greater data points. We encourage evaluating materials ML algorithms on the Matbench benchmark and comparing them against the latest version of Automatminer.},

The quantum properties were computed at the DFT(TPSSh-D3BJ/def2-SVP) level and include the electronic and dispersion energies, highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies, HOMO/LUMO gap, dipole moment, and natural charge of the metal center; GFN2-xTB polarizabilities are also provided. Pairwise representations showed the low correlation between these properties, providing nearly continuous maps with unusual regions of the chemical space, for example, complexes combining large polarizabilities with wide HOMO/LUMO gaps and complexes combining low-energy HOMO orbitals with electron-rich metal centers. The tmQM data set can be exploited in the data-driven discovery of new metal complexes, including predictive models based on machine learning. These models may have a strong impact on the fields in which transition metal chemistry plays a key role, for example, catalysis, organic synthesis, and materials science. tmQM is an open data set that can be downloaded free of charge from https://github.com/bbskjelstad/tmqm.},

    abstract = {The development of accurate and transferable machine learning (ML) potentials for predicting molecular energetics is a challenging task. The process of data generation to train such ML potentials is a task neither well understood nor researched in detail. In this work, we present a fully automated approach for the generation of datasets with the intent of training universal ML potentials. It is based on the concept of active learning (AL) via Query by Committee (QBC), which uses the disagreement between an ensemble of ML potentials to infer the reliability of the ensemble’s prediction. QBC allows the presented AL algorithm to automatically sample regions of chemical space where the ML potential fails to accurately predict the potential energy. AL improves the overall fitness of ANAKIN-ME (ANI) deep learning potentials in rigorous test cases by mitigating human biases in deciding what new training data to use. AL also reduces the training set size to a fraction of the data required when using naive random sampling techniques. To provide validation of our AL approach, we develop the COmprehensive Machine-learning Potential (COMP6) benchmark (publicly available on GitHub) which contains a diverse set of organic molecules. Active learning-based ANI potentials outperform the original random sampled ANI-1 potential with only 10\% of the data, while the final active learning-based model vastly outperforms ANI-1 on the COMP6 benchmark after training to only 25\% of the data. Finally, we show that our proposed AL technique develops a universal ANI potential (ANI-1x) that provides accurate energy and force predictions on the entire COMP6 benchmark. This universal ML potential achieves a level of accuracy on par with the best ML potentials for single molecules or materials, while remaining applicable to the general class of organic molecules composed of the elements CHNO.},

I think it's obvious that the Lagrange multiplier term in the objective function can be interpreted as an external potential. That's nothing more than interpreting the objective function itself as an energy.

abstract={Atomic partial charges appear in the Coulomb term of many force-field models and can be derived from electronic structure calculations with a myriad of atoms-in-molecules (AIM) methods. More advanced models have also been proposed, using the distributed nature of the electron cloud and atomic multipoles. In this work, an electrostatic force field is defined through a concise approximation of the electron density, for which the Coulomb interaction is trivially evaluated. This approximate ``pro-density'' is expanded in a minimal basis of atom-centered s-type Slater density functions, whose parameters are optimized by minimizing the Kullback--Leibler divergence of the pro-density from a reference electron density, e.g., obtained from an electronic structure calculation. The proposed method, Minimal Basis Iterative Stockholder (MBIS), is a variant of the Hirshfeld AIM method, but it can also be used as a density-fitting technique. An iterative algorithm to refine the pro-density is easily implemented with a linear-scaling computational cost, enabling applications to supramolecular systems. The benefits of the MBIS method are demonstrated with systematic applications to molecular databases and extended models of condensed phases. A comparison to 14 other AIM methods shows its effectiveness when modeling electrostatic interactions. MBIS is also suitable for rescaling atomic polarizabilities in the Tkatchenko--Scheffler scheme for dispersion interactions.},

Interestingly, they look like a one dimensional family. It seems to confirm that if you constrain the atoms to be spherical then they're really in a one dimensional family parametrized by charge, so there really are transferable but charge-dependent atomic densities.},

abstract={Atoms in molecules methods that rely on reference promolecular densities typically require that one define, or otherwise determine, the densities of unbound atomic anions. Whereas the isolated atomic polyanions are always physically and computationally unbound, monoanions can be either physically bound but computationally unbound (like the oxygen anion at the Hartree-Fock level of theory), or physically unbound but computationally bound (like the nitrogen anion using many DFT methods with a basis set including diffuse functions). Depending on the level of theory and basis set used, the densities of negatively charged atomic ions can decay very slowly and even be nonmonotonically decreasing. These delocalized anionic densities induce ill-behaved atomic properties for compounds containing highly reduced atoms. To treat the problem of unphysical proatom densities in iterative Hirshfeld methods, we compute the smallest (typically fractional) nuclear charge to bind all electrons, called the effective nuclear charge of an atom A. When at a given level of theory, the scaled density corresponding to the effective nuclear charge is used as the negatively charged proatom density. This novel approach dramatically improves the computational robustness of the iterative Hirshfeld partitioning scheme.},

Equation 10 is the formula for the proatom ``pseudodensity'': the electron density of the atom with augmented nuclear charge, but scaled.

It's interesting though, because it means a nitrogen won't become an oxygen even if you add a full extra nuclear charge. Instead it will be wider, as it should be.},

    abstract = {We develop a variational procedure for the iterative Hirshfeld (HI) partitioning scheme. The main practical advantage of having a variational framework is that it provides a formal and straightforward approach for imposing constraints (e.g., fixed charges on certain atoms or molecular fragments) when computing HI atoms and their properties. Unlike many other variants of the Hirshfeld partitioning scheme, HI charges do not arise naturally from the information-theoretic framework, but only as a reverse-engineered construction of the objective function. However, the procedure we use is quite general and could be applied to other problems as well. We also prove that there is always at least one solution to the HI equations, but we could not prove that its self-consistent equations would always converge for any given initial pro-atom charges. Our numerical assessment of the constrained iterative Hirshfeld method shows that it satisfies many desirable traits of atoms in molecules and has the potential to surpass existing approaches for adding constraints when computing atomic properties.},

    abstract = {The notions of ionicity and covalency of chemical bonds, effective atomic charges, and decomposition of the cohesive energy into ionic and covalent terms are fundamental yet elusive. For example, different approaches give different values of atomic charges. Pursuing the goal of formulating a universal approach based on firm physical grounds (first-principles or non-empirical), we develop a formalism based on Wannier functions with atomic orbital symmetry and capable of defining these notions and giving numerically robust results that are in excellent agreement with traditional chemical thinking. Unexpectedly, in diamond-like boron phosphide (BP), we find charges of +0.68 on phosphorus and -0.68 on boron atoms, and this anomaly is explained by the Zintl-Klemm nature of this compound. We present a simple model that includes energies of the highest occupied cationic and lowest unoccupied anionic atomic orbitals, coordination numbers, and strength of interatomic orbital overlap. This model captures the essential physics of bonding and accurately reproduces all our results, including anomalous BP.},
    annotate = {The main point seems to be an energy decomposition into ionic and covalent cohesive energy, but I read it for the computation of partial charges. Like my partial charge estimates, boron phosphide has a negative charge on boron, and also like me, they get a postive boron in boron nitride. There's a long discussion of the boron phosphide result in a section titled ``The peculiar case of BP''. There's also a positive charge on carbon in carbon monoxide, discussed in the third item of an enumerated list at the beginning of the results section. Both BP and CO are said to be explained by the Zintl-Klemm rule. There's also another explanation, in which neutral boron can make three bonds, but boron anion can make four. That seems to make sense in Lewis structures, and seems to correspond to how in organic molecules, we consider tetravalent nitrogen to have a formal positive chage. It seems handwavy. I guess the same reasoning applies to boron nitride, but we have to somehow balance this reasoning against the electronegativity difference? And I don't suppose there's any way to say beforehand how much to weight each consideration. It's like we're balancing nitrogen's covalent formal positivity with its electronegativity. But Figure 1 makes it look like it's more about how the boundaries between atoms are drawn, which seems to undermine all this reasoning.},

In the electrostatic plus (ES+) model, atomic charges are determined to equalize electronegativity. However, this model involves costly minimization of the electrostatic energy at each MD step. A preconditioned conjugate-gradient method is developed for this minimization problem by splitting the Coulomb-interaction matrix into short- and long-range components; the computationally less intensive short-range matrix is used as a preconditioner. This preconditioning scheme is found to speed up the convergence significantly. Numerical tests involving up to 26.5 million atoms are performed on a parallel computer, and the preconditioner is shown to improve the parallel efficiency by increasing data locality. The computational cost is further amortized due to the algorithmic similarity to the multiple-time-scale MD.},

There is a difficulty with the hypothesis, however, in that it is not related directly to the physics which governs the motions of the nuclei and electrons that make up the atoms and the bonds. It is the purpose of this important new book to show that a theory can be developed to underpin the molecular structure hypothesis - that the atoms in a molecule are real, with properties predicted and defined by the laws of quantum mechanics, and that the structure their presence imparts to a molecule is indeed a consequence of the underlying physics.  As a result the classification based upon the concept of atoms in molecules is freed from its empirical constraints and the full predictive power of quantum mechanics.  As a result the full predictive power of quantum mechanics can be incorporated into the resulting theory - a theory of atoms in molecules. The book is aimed at those scientists responsible for performing the experiments and collecting the observations on the properties of matter at the atomic level, in the belief that the transformation of qualitative concepts into a quantitative theory will serve to deepen our understanding of chemistry.},

The iterative scheme ensures that the Hirshfeld definition represents a mathematically proper information entropy, allows the Hirshfeld approach to be used for charged molecules, eliminates arbitrariness in the choice of the promolecule, and increases the magnitudes of the charges.

I think the essence of it is to have a family of reference densities for each element parameterized by the population, but that abstract formulation doesn't seem to appear anywhere in the paper. Rather, equation 19 gives a specific parametrized family, obtained by linearly interpolating between integer charge densities of free atoms.

abstract={Advances in machine learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs), such as those using neural networks, have resulted in short-range models that can infer interaction energies with near ab initio accuracy and orders of magnitude reduced computational cost. For many atom systems, including macromolecules, biomolecules, and condensed matter, model accuracy can become reliant on the description of short- and long-range physical interactions. The latter terms can be difficult to incorporate into an MLIP framework. Recent research has produced numerous models with considerations for nonlocal electrostatic and dispersion interactions, leading to a large range of applications that can be addressed using MLIPs. In light of this, we present a Perspective focused on key methodologies and models being used where the presence of nonlocal physics and chemistry are crucial for describing system properties. The strategies covered include MLIPs augmented with dispersion corrections, electrostatics calculated with charges predicted from atomic environment descriptors, the use of self-consistency and message passing iterations to propagated nonlocal system information, and charges obtained via equilibration schemes. We aim to provide a pointed discussion to support the development of machine learning-based interatomic potentials for systems where contributions from only nearsighted terms are deficient.},

abstract={Machine learning potentials (MLPs) have revolutionized the field of atomistic simulations by describing atomic interactions with the accuracy of electronic structure methods at a small fraction of the cost. Most current MLPs construct the energy of a system as a sum of atomic energies, which depend on information about the atomic environments provided in the form of predefined or learnable feature vectors. If, in addition, nonlocal phenomena like long-range charge transfer are important, fourth-generation MLPs need to be used, which include a charge equilibration (Qeq) step to take the global structure of the system into account. This Qeq can significantly increase the computational cost and thus can become a computational bottleneck for large systems. In this Article, we present a highly efficient formulation of Qeq that does not require the explicit computation of the Coulomb matrix elements, resulting in a quasi-linear scaling method. Moreover, our approach also allows for the efficient calculation of energy derivatives, which explicitly consider the global structure-dependence of the atomic charges as obtained from Qeq. Due to its generality, the method is not restricted to MLPs and can also be applied within a variety of other force fields.},

abstract={Machine learning (ML) has demonstrated its potential in atomistic simulations to bridge the gap between accurate first-principles methods and computationally efficient empirical potentials. This is achieved by learning mappings between a system's structure and its physical properties. State-of-the-art models for potential energy surfaces typically represent chemical structures through (semi-)local atomic environments. However, this approach neglects long-range interactions (most notably electrostatics) and non-local phenomena such as charge transfer, leading to significant errors in the description of molecules or materials in polar anisotropic environments. To address these challenges, ML frameworks that predict self-consistent charge distributions in atomistic systems using the Charge Equilibration (QEq) method are currently popular. In this approach, atomic charges are derived from an electrostatic energy expression that incorporates environment-dependent atomic electronegativities. Herein, we explore the limits of this concept at the example of the previously reported Kernel Charge Equilibration (kQEq) approach, combined with local short-ranged potentials. To this end we consider prototypical systems with varying total charge states and applied electric fields. We find that charge equilibration-based models perform well in most situations. However, we also find that some pathologies of conventional QEq carry over to the ML variants in the form of spurious charge transfer and overpolarization in the presence of static electric fields. This indicates a need for new methodological developments.},

References in the introduction could be helpful for getting up to date with the field.

Next section on external fields seems to say that perturbed molecules are valuable training data for prediction on unperturbed ones.},

abstract={Machine learning (ML) methods have become powerful, predictive tools in a wide range of applications, such as facial recognition and autonomous vehicles. In the sciences, computational chemists and physicists have been using ML for the prediction of physical phenomena, such as atomistic potential energy surfaces and reaction pathways. Transferable ML potentials, such as ANI-1x, have been developed with the goal of accurately simulating organic molecules containing the chemical elements H, C, N, and O. Here, we provide an extension of the ANI-1x model. The new model, dubbed ANI-2x, is trained to three additional chemical elements: S, F, and Cl. Additionally, ANI-2x underwent torsional refinement training to better predict molecular torsion profiles. These new features open a wide range of new applications within organic chemistry and drug development. These seven elements (H, C, N, O, F, Cl, and S) make up ~90\% of drug-like molecules. To show that these additions do not sacrifice accuracy, we have tested this model across a range of organic molecules and applications, including the COMP6 benchmark, dihedral rotations, conformer scoring, and nonbonded interactions. ANI-2x is shown to accurately predict molecular energies compared to density functional theory with a ~106 factor speedup and a negligible slowdown compared to ANI-1x and shows subchemical accuracy across most of the COMP6 benchmark. The resulting model is a valuable tool for drug development which can potentially replace both quantum calculations and classical force fields for a myriad of applications.},

abstract={This paper results from a round table discussion at the CCTC2018 Conference in Changsha City, Hunan, China, in December 2018. It presents a report on the status, prospects, and issues of conceptual density functional theory (CDFT). After a short exposition on the history of CDFT, its fundamentals, philosophy, and successes are highlighted. Then ten issues for reflection on the future of conceptual DFT are formulated and discussed, ending with one or more summarizing statements on the present status of various concepts/principles/practices and proposed directions for future research. The issues include the further analysis of the energy functional, E[N,v], extended to include effects of temperature, solvent, and mechanical forces, basic requirements for physically acceptable response functions as reactivity descriptors, the use of the grand canonical ensemble, the relevance of CDFT for chemical kinetics and thermodynamics, the domain of validity of CDFT-based principles, the combination of CDFT with reaction path calculations, information-theoretic descriptors, and the treatment of excited states and time dependence. The final issue advocates the transition of CDFT from an interpretative to a predictive mode; we believe this is of utmost importance for promoting CDFT as a viable alternative to wave function-based methods for the practicing chemist, a separate issue treated in the final section.},

The first two are of course necessary background for the electronegativity equalization. The emphasis of the paper seems to be on reactivity, but section 3.5 is about electronegativity equalization. In fact, it says "The initial impetus for CDFT arose from its ability to simply and rigorously explain the origins of the electronegativity equality method/principle".},

Most of the established methods, however, rely on local properties and are thus unable to take global changes in the electronic structure into account, which result from long-range charge transfer or different charge states. In this work we overcome this limitation by introducing a fourth-generation high-dimensional neural network potential that combines a charge equilibration scheme employing environment-dependent atomic electronegativities with accurate atomic energies. The method, which is able to correctly describe global charge distributions in arbitrary systems, yields much improved energies and substantially extends the applicability of modern machine learning potentials.

Finally, we demonstrate the accuracy of our approach on complex systems: solid and liquid state sodium chloride. We attain accuracy in energy and forces better than the model based on local descriptors and show that our electrostatic approach can capture the density functional theory tail of the potential energy surface of the isolated Na-Cl dimer, which the local descriptor-based model fails to describe.},

In this paper, they differentiate it twice to get a Hessian, and confirm that the results are not close to the actual Hessian. This is 'spectroscopic' because it's related to infrared spectroscopy.

  abstract="A new polarizable force field (PFF), namely atom-condensed Kohn-Sham density functional theory approximated to second order (ACKS2), is proposed for the efficient computation of atomic charges and linear response properties of extended molecular systems. It is derived from Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT), making use of two novel ingredients in the context of PFFs: (i) constrained atomic populations and (ii) the Legendre transform of the Kohn-Sham kinetic energy. ACKS2 is essentially an extension of the Electronegativity Equalization Method (EEM) in which two major EEM shortcomings are fixed: ACKS2 predicts a linear size-dependence of the dipole polarizability in the macroscopic limit and correctly describes the charge distribution when a molecule dissociates. All ACKS2 parameters are defined as atoms-in-molecules expectation values. The implementation of ACKS2 is very similar to that of EEM, with only a small increase in computational cost.",
  annotate="It seems like there's two possible uses of the technique in this paper. One would be to compute the 'actual' energy terms from the wavefunction, so we can see how close the statistical fit is. The other is that it gives some ideas for recognizing transferability. The basic idea sems to be to consider the hardness matrix as usually derived to be complete: that is, it's everything you get from factorizing the density matrix, and becomes the usual Coulomb term. Everything else becomes part of a new term 'T'. 'T' depends on a 'linear response matrix' which includes bonding and conjugation. This is exciting because it makes it seem possible to calculate the 'true' interaction terms of electronegativity equalization, or rather, the 'true' correction to the coulomb terms. It also makes it clear how conjugation shoudl affect the result. What's still confusing to me is how kinetic energy is included. I always thought kinetic energy was part of the diagonal of the hardness matrix. It seems that there's also neighbor-dependent corrections which end up as part of 'T'? It's worth following the derivation more closely to understand this issue. Bader kinetic energies should be transferable properties of the density wtihin an atomic basin, so I don't see why they should be included in a nonlocal term like this."

    abstract = {An extensive benchmark of the electronegativity equalization method (EEM) and the split charge equilibration (SQE) model on a very diverse set of organic molecules is presented. These models efficiently compute atomic partial charges and are used in the development of polarizable force fields. The predicted partial charges that depend on empirical parameters are calibrated to reproduce results from quantum mechanical calculations. Recently, SQE is presented as an extension of the EEM to obtain the correct size dependence of the molecular polarizability. In this work, 12 parametrization protocols are applied to each model and the optimal parameters are benchmarked systematically. The training data for the empirical parameters comprise of MP2/Aug-CC-pVDZ calculations on 500 organic molecules containing the elements H, C, N, O, F, S, Cl, and Br. These molecules have been selected by an ingenious and autonomous protocol from an initial set of almost 500000 small organic molecules. It is clear that the SQE model outperforms the EEM in all benchmark assessments. When using Hirshfeld-I charges for the calibration, the SQE model optimally reproduces the molecular electrostatic potential from the ab initio calculations. Applications on chain molecules, i.e., alkanes, alkenes, and alpha alanine helices, confirm that the EEM gives rise to a divergent behavior for the polarizability, while the SQE model shows the correct trends. We conclude that the SQE model is an essential component of a polarizable force field, showing several advantages over the original EEM.},

They describe this as ``static'' (no field) vs ``response'' (with field). It surprised me that this actually made the predictions worse, as seen in Table V. It's understandable that it should make the prediction somewhat worse, because the linearity assumption is violated once the charges get too far from their usual value. However, my own observation has been the the nonlinearity isn't that serious, even across surprisingly wide ranges of charge. It's hard to put a number on that though and say how much error to expect due to nonlinearity.},

abstract={Charge equilibration models such as the electronegativity equalization method (EEM) and the split charge equilibration (SQE) are extensively used in the literature for the efficient computation of accurate atomic charges in molecules. However, there is no consensus on a generic set of optimal parameters, even when one only considers parameters calibrated against atomic charges in organic molecules. In this work, the origin of the disagreement in the parameters is investigated by comparing and analyzing six sets of parameters based on two sets of molecules and three calibration procedures. The resulting statistical analysis clearly indicates that the conventional least-squares cost function based solely on atomic charges is in general ill-conditioned and not capable of fixing all parameters in a charge-equilibration model. Methodological guidelines are formulated to improve the stability of the parameters. Although in this case a simple interpretation of individual parameters is not possible, charge equilibration models remain of great practical use for the computation of atomic charges.},
annotate={This paper shows that the minima of QEq training loss functions have near-singular subspaces. The lowest eigenvalue corresponds to adjustment of the electronegativity and hardness of fluorine, which is unsurprising: how can you determine hardness if charge doesn't vary? Even in my regression framing, no variation, no confidence in effect. Verstraelen doesn't seem to think underdetermination of the parameters is a real issue, since all these parameters make the same predictions anyway. It's hard to say; we want to extrapolate, but we don't expect to have to make predictions on neutral fluorine, do we? Figure 3 shows that in a chlorine-containing molecule, there's seemingly no change in charge prediction when adjusting the parameters along an eigenvector that involves the parameters of chlorine. In a discussion of the binary system predictions (equation 18), Toon explains why you get this kind of underdetermination: an increase in electronegativity can be compensated by a decrease in hardness. That makes sense because electronegativity increases charge transfer and hardness decreases it. At least for fluorine which is always more electronegative them whatever it is bonded to; once there's elements on either side of it, electronegativity and hardness will have different effects. More relevant to my own work, he discusses that these ambiguities could be resolved by including external potentials, though the paper doesn't seem to do that. It seems that this would disambiguate electronegativity and hardness because hardness scales the response to the external field, though I didn't see him say that directly anywhere. One odd thing about this paper is the loss function in equation 4. It softens the charge constraint so that you don't need to have perfect integer charge. I don't understand the motivation for this, because the reference charges we're trying to predict have this constraint, so it's like we're throwing away information. He claims that if you do this you can determine the electronegativity parameters without having to standardize to an arbitrary reference value. It seems impossible at first, but the trick is using the Mulliken electronegativity in defining the loss of function. This means that he's doing simulations of ions. If you're doing simulations of ions then you can break the total charge constraint that makes the electronegativity underdetermined. If I had good ion simulations I would just include them in the training data and determine the absolute electronegativity that way.},

It is shown that this response lies at the core of the concept of the functional group. The manipulation of fractional electron populations is carried out by using distribution functions for the electron number within the quantum basins. Several test systems are studied to show that similar chemical potential groups are characterized by similar energetic behavior upon interaction with other groups. The origin of the empirical additivity rules for group energies in simple hydrocarbons is also investigated. It turns out to rest on the independent saturation of both the self-energies and the interaction energies of the groups as the size of the chain increases.

annotate="IQA studies of lithium hydride, and of a series basically identical to mine: fully saturated molecules with two heavy atoms. The lithium hydride simulations are about bond stretching, and demonstrate that lithium's chemical potential is basically constant as the bond stretched, when defined as derivative of IQA energy of lithium as a function of charge of lithium (figure 2). This is an odd result, since I would expect chemical potential to be linear as a function of charge, not constant. I still don't understand what's being shown in the carbon series. All simulations were done at the Hartree-Fock level, which I guess eliminates the ambiguities in partitioning the energy, at the expense of not being trustworthy with the high correlation energy that you get from stretched bonds, which seems to undermine the lithium hydride results."

The data show that the electronegativity of a group is largely determined by the connecting atom: atoms that are one bond or more removed have very little effect on the electronegativity of a group. The small effect of atoms one bond or more removed, however, is consistent with qualitative predictions: the higher the electronegativity of B for a given A, the greater the electronegativity of group -AB. Two other trends of note are, firstly, that increasing unsaturation in the vicinal bond increases electronegativity and, secondly, that protonation increases electronegativity of a group while deprotonation decreases it.},
  annotate={Tests electronegativity of a group by how it withdraws electrons from hydrogen. So a methyl group will be tested by simulating methane. The bond critical point is the minimum of electron density along the bond path, so for a more electronegative group it should be closer to hydrogen. Formula 3 seems to say the opposite: electronegativity is proportional to the distance between the bond critical point and hydrogen. However, this "electronegativity factor" is raised to a negative power, so it should really be interpreted more as a chemical potential. Comparing a methyl and fluoromethyl group in table 1, the bond length is about the same, but the critical point is closer to hydrogen, resulting in a higher electronegativity for fluoromethyl (which means I read the formula wrong?). Critical point density also makes electronegativity higher (makes electronegativity factor smaller in formula 3), I guess because more electron density is pulled from hydrogen into the bond.}

    abstract = { Current neural networks for predictions of molecular properties use quantum chemistry only as a source of training data. This paper explores models that use quantum chemistry as an integral part of the prediction process. This is done by implementing self-consistent-charge Density-Functional-Tight-Binding (DFTB) theory as a layer for use in deep learning models. The DFTB layer takes, as input, Hamiltonian matrix elements generated from earlier layers and produces, as output, electronic properties from self-consistent field solutions of the corresponding DFTB Hamiltonian. Backpropagation enables efficient training of the model to target electronic properties. Two types of input to the DFTB layer are explored, splines and feed-forward neural networks. Because overfitting can cause models trained on smaller molecules to perform poorly on larger molecules, regularizations are applied that penalize nonmonotonic behavior and deviation of the Hamiltonian matrix elements from those of the published DFTB model used to initialize the model. The approach is evaluated on 15700 hydrocarbons by comparing the root-mean-square error in energy and dipole moment, on test molecules with eight heavy atoms, to the error from the initial DFTB model. When trained on molecules with up to seven heavy atoms, the spline model reduces the test error in energy by 60\% and in dipole moments by 42\%. The neural network model performs somewhat better, with error reductions of 67\% and 59\%, respectively. Training on molecules with up to four heavy atoms reduces performance, with both the spline and neural net models reducing the test error in energy by about 53\% and in dipole by about 25\%.

The method is based on a second-order expansion of the Kohn-Sham total energy in density-functional theory (DFT) with respect to charge density fluctuations. The zeroth order approach is equivalent to a common standard non-self-consistent (TB) scheme, while at second order a transparent, parameter-free, and readily calculable expression for generalized Hamiltonian matrix elements may be derived. These are modified by a self-consistent redistribution of Mulliken charges (SCC). Besides the usual “band structure” and short-range repulsive terms the final approximate Kohn-Sham energy additionally includes a Coulomb interaction between charge fluctuations. At large distances this accounts for long-range electrostatic forces between two point charges and approximately includes self-interaction contributions of a given atom if the charges are located at one and the same atom. We apply the new SCC scheme to problems where deficiencies within the non-SCC standard TB approach become obvious. We thus considerably improve transferability.},
  annotate = {Seems to be the original paper on density functional tight binding (DFTB) with self-consistent charge (SCC). In section IV, addresses the elements of the hardness matrix. The diagonal elements, the hardnesses, are assumed to be the free atom hardnesses, which seems like it would add some error since in electronegativity equalization (EEq) fitting these are typically found to be significantly larger in a molecule than in a free atom. An expression is given for the off-diagonal interaction terms, and it is noted that in the long distance limit they approach being Coulomb terms, which is the approximation typically used in EEq. There are also ``tau'' parameters involved in the formula for the off-diagonal interaction terms, with a specific parameter for each element rather than for each atom pair, apparently calculated from a simulation of a free atom. I thought that DFTB involves parametrizing element pairs or bond types but I don't see that here. The advantage in accuracy over a non self-consistent calculation seems small. I think the main reason I want to use self-consistent calculations is just because XTB is self-consistent and it's so good. But it comes with a significant disadvantage during training. The charges used are Mulliken charges, and Mulliken charges typically are provided in big benchmark datasets like QM9, though since they're basis-dependent it's not clear how to translate them. However, training on crystal structure databases would require filling in the charges somehow, either through DFT or using the structure factors.}

ReaxFF uses a general relationship between bond distance and bond order on one hand and between bond order and bond energy on the other hand that leads to proper dissociation of bonds to separated atoms. Other valence terms present in the force field (angle and torsion) are defined in terms of the same bond orders so that all these terms go to zero smoothly as bonds break. In addition, ReaxFF has Coulomb and Morse (van der Waals) potentials to describe nonbond interactions between all atoms (no exclusions). These nonbond interactions are shielded at short range so that the Coulomb and van der Waals interactions become constant as Rij → 0. We report here the ReaxFF for hydrocarbons. The parameters were derived from quantum chemical calculations on bond dissociation and reactions of small molecules plus heat of formation and geometry data for a number of stable hydrocarbon compounds. We find that the ReaxFF provides a good description of these data. Generally, the results are of an accuracy similar or better than PM3, while ReaxFF is about 100 times faster. In turn, the PM3 is about 100 times faster than the QC calculations. Thus, with ReaxFF we hope to be able to study complex reactions in hydrocarbons.},

Or more specifically it distinguishes itself from charge equilibration as defined by Rappé and Goddard 1991.

  abstract = {Formulas have been developed to calculate the forces in a molecular system directly, rather than indirectly through the agency of energy. This permits an independent calculation of the slope of the curves of energy vs. position of the nuclei, and may thus increase the accuracy, or decrease the labor involved in the calculation of these curves. The force on a nucleus in an atomic system is shown to be just the classical electrostatic force that would be exerted on this nucleus by other nuclei and by the electrons' charge distribution. Qualitative implications of this are discussed.},
  annotate = {Feynman's paper containing the Feynman-Hellman theorem. Shows how to avoid the discrete difference method in differentiating energy with respect to nuclear positions to obtain forces. This is actually analogous to what is achieved by using one of the thermodynamic relations of constrained density functional theory to relate the derivative of energy with respect to an atomic electron population to the magnitude of the imposed potential. I generalized this to include partial charge definitions where the weight function depends on the density, which ends up requiring a expectation using the computed density, but does not require varying electron populations, so it's analogous to Feynman's goal in this paper, at least from the computational perspective. Feynman's perspective was really more conceptual than computational, which suggests the challenge of finding some classical physics here that the quantum mechanics is disguising.}

    abstract = { The computational bottleneck of the extremely fast simplified Tamm-Dancoff approximated (sTDA) time-dependent density functional theory procedure [S. Grimme, J. Chem. Phys. 138, 244104 (2013)] for the computation of electronic spectra for large systems is the determination of the ground state Kohn-Sham orbitals and eigenvalues. This limits such treatments to single structures with a few hundred atoms and hence, e.g., sampling along molecular dynamics trajectories for flexible systems or the calculation of chromophore aggregates is often not possible. The aim of this work is to solve this problem by a specifically designed semi-empirical tight binding (TB) procedure similar to the well established self-consistent-charge density functional TB scheme. The new special purpose method provides orbitals and orbital energies of hybrid density functional character for a subsequent and basically unmodified sTDA procedure. Compared to many previous semi-empirical excited state methods, an advantage of the ansatz is that a general eigenvalue problem in a non-orthogonal, extended atomic orbital basis is solved and therefore correct occupied/virtual orbital energy splittings as well as Rydberg levels are obtained. A key idea for the success of the new model is that the determination of atomic charges (describing an effective electron-electron interaction) and the one-particle spectrum is decoupled and treated by two differently parametrized Hamiltonians/basis sets. The three-diagonalization-step composite procedure can routinely compute broad range electronic spectra (0-8 eV) within minutes of computation time for systems composed of 500-1000 atoms with an accuracy typical of standard time-dependent density functional theory (0.3-0.5 eV average error). An easily extendable parametrization based on coupled-cluster and density functional computed reference data for the elements H–Zn including transition metals is described. The accuracy of the method termed sTDA-xTB is first benchmarked for vertical excitation energies of open- and closed-shell systems in comparison to other semi-empirical methods and applied to exemplary problems in electronic spectroscopy. As side products of the development, a robust and efficient valence electron TB method for the accurate determination of atomic charges as well as a more accurate calculation scheme of dipole rotatory strengths within the Tamm-Dancoff approximation is proposed. },

    annotate = {Interesting multistep approach that shows the importance of partial charges computation of excitation energies. The importances stated in section E.1. It says "Already at this point, it is important to mention that the computed sTDA-xTB excitation energies are sensitive to the quality of the input atomic charges. We speculate that the relative large excitation energy errors of many semi-empirical methods (see below) are directly related to errors in the charge distribution."}

title = {A Robust Non-Self-Consistent Tight-Binding Quantum Chemistry Method for large Molecules},
doi = {10.26434/chemrxiv.8326202},
abstract = {We propose a semiempirical quantum chemical method, designed for the fast calculation of molecular Geometries, vibrational Frequencies and Non-covalent interaction energies (GFN) of systems with up to a few thousand atoms. Like its predecessors GFN-xTB and GFN2-xTB, the new method termed GFN0-xTB is parameterized for all elements up to radon (Z = 86) and mostly shares well-known density functional tight-binding approximations as well as basis set and integral approximations. The main new feature is the avoidance of the self-consistent charge iterations leading to speed-ups of a factor of 2-20 depending on the size and electronic complexity of the system. This is achieved by including only quantum mechanical contributions up to first-order which are incorporated similar to the previous versions without any pair-specific parameterization. The essential electrostatic electronic interaction is treated by a classical electronegativity equilibration charge model yielding atomic partial charges that enter the electronic Hamiltonian indirectly. Furthermore, the atomic charge-dependent D4 dispersion correction is included to account for long range London correlation effects. Formulas for analytical total energy gradients with respect to nuclear displacements are derived and implemented in the xtb code allowing numerically very precise structure optimizations. The neglect of self-consistent energy terms not only leads to a large gain in computational speed but also can increase robustness in electronically difficult situations because ill-convergence or artificial charge-transfer (CT) is avoided. The comparison of GFN0-xTB and GFN/GFN2-xTB allows dissection of quantum electronic polarization and CT effects thereby improving our understanding of chemical bonding. Compared to the most sophisticated multipole-based GFN2-xTB model (which approaches DFT accuracy for the target properties closely), GFN0-xTB performs slightly worse for non-covalent interactions and molecular structures, while very good results are observed for conformational energies. Vibrational frequencies are obtained less accurately than with GFN/GFN2-xTB but they may still be useful for various purposes like estimating relative thermostatistical reaction energies. Most exceptional is the fact that even relatively complicated transition metal complex structures can be accurately optimized with a non-self-consistent quantum approach. The new method bridges the gap between force-fields and traditional semiempirical methods with its excellent computational cost to accuracy ratio and is intended to explore the chemical space of large molecular systems and solids.},

It is the negative of the chemical potential (the Lagrange multiplier for the normalization constraint) in the Hohenberg–Kohn density functional theory of the ground state [unicode left out]. Electronegativity is constant throughout an atom or molecule, and constant from orbital to orbital within an atom or molecule. Definitions are given of the concepts of an atom in a molecule and of a valence state of an atom in a molecule, and it is shown how valence‐state electronegativity differences drive charge transfers on molecule formation. An equation of Gibbs–Duhem type is given for the change of electronegativity from one situation to another, and some discussion is given of certain relations among energy components discovered by Fraga.},

    annotate = {Definition of the electronegativity of a system, in equation 12. A disappointing result that the Thomas-Fermi theory cannot give you electronegativities of atoms; in section VI it is argued that they will always be computed to be zero. Atomic electronegativities are discussed in section IX, ``Atoms in molecules''. That leads to formula 75, a relationship between the energy difference and the squared chemical potential difference. Of course in the linear electronegativity model, the proportionality constant is related to the ``total hardness''. Here, it is shown to be some functional of the atomic densities. The atomic electronegativities depend on a quantity ``Q'', which is introduced in a ``Gibbs-Duhem equation'' in section V, in equation 22. It seems that there is a lot to learn here not just about the electronegativity of the system, but about electronegativities of atoms in molecules, which I had previously thought were not introduced until the Mortier-Ghosh-Shankar electronegativity equalization paper.}

After defining hardness as a derivative and introducing a discrete difference approximation that looks analogous to the formula for Mulliken electronegativity, most of the paper is about the principle of hard and soft acids and bases. There's a few other interesting connections in the conclusions, where it points out that hardness is the band gap of an insulator.}
