abstract={Machine learning potentials have become an important tool for atomistic simulations in many fields, from chemistry via molecular biology to materials science. Most of the established methods, however, rely on local properties and are thus unable to take global changes in the electronic structure into account, which result from long-range charge transfer or different charge states. In this work we overcome this limitation by introducing a fourth-generation high-dimensional neural network potential that combines a charge equilibration scheme employing environment-dependent atomic electronegativities with accurate atomic energies. The method, which is able to correctly describe global charge distributions in arbitrary systems, yields much improved energies and substantially extends the applicability of modern machine learning potentials. This is demonstrated for a series of systems representing typical scenarios in chemistry and materials science that are incorrectly described by current methods, while the fourth-generation neural network potential is in excellent agreement with electronic structure calculations.},

This new approach can accurately describe the potential energy surface of systems with ionic and covalent interactions as well as systems with multiple charge states. Moreover, it can either be regressed against known atomic charge decompositions or trained without charge targets, without compromising the accuracy of energy and forces. We benchmark our approach against other state-of-the-art models and prove it to have equivalent performances on a set of simple reference systems while being less computationally expensive. Finally, we demonstrate the accuracy of our approach on complex systems: solid and liquid state sodium chloride. We attain accuracy in energy and forces better than the model based on local descriptors and show that our electrostatic approach can capture the density functional theory tail of the potential energy surface of the isolated Na-Cl dimer, which the local descriptor-based model fails to describe.},

Recently, it has started being used for the calculation of other reactivity descriptors and for the development of polarizable and reactive force fields. For such applications, it is of interest to know whether the method, through the inclusion of the molecular geometry in the Taylor expansion of the energy, would also allow sufficiently accurate predictions of spectroscopic data. In this work, relevant quantities for IR spectroscopy are considered, namely the dipole derivatives and the Cartesian Hessian. Despite careful calibration of parameters for this specific task, it is shown that the current models yield insufficiently accurate results.",

These seem sufficient for capturing the changes in energy as charge is redistributed around the molecule, which depends on the geometry. However, EEq is not a force field, at most a supplement to a force field. So you wouldn't expect differentiating it to give you accurate forces. In this paper, they differentiate it twice to get a Hessian, and confirm that the results are not close to the actual Hessian. This is 'spectroscopic' because it's related to infrared spectroscopy. There's no attempt at band gaps."

  abstract="A new polarizable force field (PFF), namely atom-condensed Kohn-Sham density functional theory approximated to second order (ACKS2), is proposed for the efficient computation of atomic charges and linear response properties of extended molecular systems. It is derived from Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT), making use of two novel ingredients in the context of PFFs: (i) constrained atomic populations and (ii) the Legendre transform of the Kohn-Sham kinetic energy. ACKS2 is essentially an extension of the Electronegativity Equalization Method (EEM) in which two major EEM shortcomings are fixed: ACKS2 predicts a linear size-dependence of the dipole polarizability in the macroscopic limit and correctly describes the charge distribution when a molecule dissociates. All ACKS2 parameters are defined as atoms-in-molecules expectation values. The implementation of ACKS2 is very similar to that of EEM, with only a small increase in computational cost.",
  annotate="It seems like there's two possible uses of the technique in this paper. One would be to compute the 'actual' energy terms from the wavefunction, so we can see how close the statistical fit is. The other is that it gives some ideas for recognizing transferability. The basic idea sems to be to consider the hardness matrix as usually derived to be complete: that is, it's everything you get from factorizing the density matrix, and becomes the usual Coulomb term. Everything else becomes part of a new term 'T'. 'T' depends on a 'linear response matrix' which includes bonding and conjugation. This is exciting because it makes it seem possible to calculate the 'true' interaction terms of electronegativity equalization, or rather, the 'true' correction to the coulomb terms. It also makes it clear how conjugation shoudl affect the result. What's still confusing to me is how kinetic energy is included. I always thought kinetic energy was part of the diagonal of the hardness matrix. It seems that there's also neighbor-dependent corrections which end up as part of 'T'? It's worth following the derivation more closely to understand this issue. Bader kinetic energies should be transferable properties of the density wtihin an atomic basin, so I don't see why they should be included in a nonlocal term like this."

These models efficiently compute atomic partial charges and are used in the development of polarizable force fields. The predicted partial charges that depend on empirical parameters are calibrated to reproduce results from quantum mechanical calculations. Recently, SQE is presented as an extension of the EEM to obtain the correct size dependence of the molecular polarizability. In this work, 12 parametrization protocols are applied to each model and the optimal parameters are benchmarked systematically. The training data for the empirical parameters comprise of MP2/Aug-CC-pVDZ calculations on 500 organic molecules containing the elements H, C, N, O, F, S, Cl, and Br. These molecules have been selected by an ingenious and autonomous protocol from an initial set of almost 500 000 small organic molecules. It is clear that the SQE model outperforms the EEM in all benchmark assessments. When using Hirshfeld-I charges for the calibration, the SQE model optimally reproduces the molecular electrostatic potential from the ab initio calculations. Applications on chain molecules, i.e., alkanes, alkenes, and alpha alanine helices, confirm that the EEM gives rise to a divergent behavior for the polarizability, while the SQE model shows the correct trends. We conclude that the SQE model is an essential component of a polarizable force field, showing several advantages over the original EEM.},

abstract={Charge equilibration models such as the electronegativity equalization method (EEM) and the split charge equilibration (SQE) are extensively used in the literature for the efficient computation of accurate atomic charges in molecules. However, there is no consensus on a generic set of optimal parameters, even when one only considers parameters calibrated against atomic charges in organic molecules. In this work, the origin of the disagreement in the parameters is investigated by comparing and analyzing six sets of parameters based on two sets of molecules and three calibration procedures. The resulting statistical analysis clearly indicates that the conventional least-squares cost function based solely on atomic charges is in general ill-conditioned and not capable of fixing all parameters in a charge-equilibration model. Methodological guidelines are formulated to improve the stability of the parameters. Although in this case a simple interpretation of individual parameters is not possible, charge equilibration models remain of great practical use for the computation of atomic charges.},

I feel like I could make the perfect EEq dataset that determines all the parameters, but I'm not sure tha twould be interesting. I've also considered that maybe the reason the parameters are undetermined is simply because multiple classes of atoms are being collapsed to a single one. Verstraelen doesn't seem to think underdetermination of the parameters is a real issue, since all these parameters make the same predictions anyway. I think it is because we want to extrapolate.},

It is shown that this response lies at the core of the concept of the functional group. The manipulation of fractional electron populations is carried out by using distribution functions for the electron number within the quantum basins. Several test systems are studied to show that similar chemical potential groups are characterized by similar energetic behavior upon interaction with other groups. The origin of the empirical additivity rules for group energies in simple hydrocarbons is also investigated. It turns out to rest on the independent saturation of both the self-energies and the interaction energies of the groups as the size of the chain increases. We also show that our results are compatible with the standard group energies of the QTAM.",

The lithium hydride simulations are about bond stretching, and demonstrate that lithium's chemical potential is basically constant as the bond stretched, when defined as derivative of IQA energy of lithium as a function of charge of lithium (figure 2). This is an odd result, since I would expect chemical potential to be linear as a function of charge, not constant. I still don't understand what's being shown in the carbon series. All simulations were done at the Hartree-Fock level, which I guess eliminates the ambiguities in partitioning the energy, at the expense of not being trustworthy with the high correlation energy that you get from stretched bonds, which seems to undermine the lithium hydride results."

The data show that the electronegativity of a group is largely determined by the connecting atom: atoms that are one bond or more removed have very little effect on the electronegativity of a group. The small effect of atoms one bond or more removed, however, is consistent with qualitative predictions: the higher the electronegativity of B for a given A, the greater the electronegativity of group -AB. Two other trends of note are, firstly, that increasing unsaturation in the vicinal bond increases electronegativity and, secondly, that protonation increases electronegativity of a group while deprotonation decreases it.},
  annotate={Tests electronegativity of a group by how it withdraws electrons from hydrogen. So a methyl group will be tested by simulating methane. The bond critical point is the minimum of electron density along the bond path, so for a more electronegative group it should be closer to hydrogen. Formula 3 seems to say the opposite: electronegativity is proportional to the distance between the bond critical point and hydrogen. However, this "electronegativity factor" is raised to a negative power, so it should really be interpreted more as a chemical potential. Comparing a methyl and fluoromethyl group in table 1, the bond length is about the same, but the critical point is closer to hydrogen, resulting in a higher electronegativity for fluoromethyl (which means I read the formula wrong?). Critical point density also makes electronegativity higher (makes electronegativity factor smaller in formula 3), I guess because more electron density is pulled from hydrogen into the bond.}

    abstract = { Current neural networks for predictions of molecular properties use quantum chemistry only as a source of training data. This paper explores models that use quantum chemistry as an integral part of the prediction process. This is done by implementing self-consistent-charge Density-Functional-Tight-Binding (DFTB) theory as a layer for use in deep learning models. The DFTB layer takes, as input, Hamiltonian matrix elements generated from earlier layers and produces, as output, electronic properties from self-consistent field solutions of the corresponding DFTB Hamiltonian. Backpropagation enables efficient training of the model to target electronic properties. Two types of input to the DFTB layer are explored, splines and feed-forward neural networks. Because overfitting can cause models trained on smaller molecules to perform poorly on larger molecules, regularizations are applied that penalize nonmonotonic behavior and deviation of the Hamiltonian matrix elements from those of the published DFTB model used to initialize the model. The approach is evaluated on 15700 hydrocarbons by comparing the root-mean-square error in energy and dipole moment, on test molecules with eight heavy atoms, to the error from the initial DFTB model. When trained on molecules with up to seven heavy atoms, the spline model reduces the test error in energy by 60\% and in dipole moments by 42\%. The neural network model performs somewhat better, with error reductions of 67\% and 59\%, respectively. Training on molecules with up to four heavy atoms reduces performance, with both the spline and neural net models reducing the test error in energy by about 53\% and in dipole by about 25\%.

The method is based on a second-order expansion of the Kohn-Sham total energy in density-functional theory (DFT) with respect to charge density fluctuations. The zeroth order approach is equivalent to a common standard non-self-consistent (TB) scheme, while at second order a transparent, parameter-free, and readily calculable expression for generalized Hamiltonian matrix elements may be derived. These are modified by a self-consistent redistribution of Mulliken charges (SCC). Besides the usual “band structure” and short-range repulsive terms the final approximate Kohn-Sham energy additionally includes a Coulomb interaction between charge fluctuations. At large distances this accounts for long-range electrostatic forces between two point charges and approximately includes self-interaction contributions of a given atom if the charges are located at one and the same atom. We apply the new SCC scheme to problems where deficiencies within the non-SCC standard TB approach become obvious. We thus considerably improve transferability.},
  annotate = {Seems to be the original paper on density functional tight binding (DFTB) with self-consistent charge (SCC). In section IV, addresses the elements of the hardness matrix. The diagonal elements, the hardnesses, are assumed to be the free atom hardnesses, which seems like it would add some error since in electronegativity equalization (EEq) fitting these are typically found to be significantly larger in a molecule than in a free atom. An expression is given for the off-diagonal interaction terms, and it is noted that in the long distance limit they approach being Coulomb terms, which is the approximation typically used in EEq. There are also ``tau'' parameters involved in the formula for the off-diagonal interaction terms, with a specific parameter for each element rather than for each atom pair, apparently calculated from a simulation of a free atom. I thought that DFTB involves parametrizing element pairs or bond types but I don't see that here. The advantage in accuracy over a non self-consistent calculation seems small. I think the main reason I want to use self-consistent calculations is just because XTB is self-consistent and it's so good. But it comes with a significant disadvantage during training. The charges used are Mulliken charges, and Mulliken charges typically are provided in big benchmark datasets like QM9, though since they're basis-dependent it's not clear how to translate them. However, training on crystal structure databases would require filling in the charges somehow, either through DFT or using the structure factors.}

Formula 21 shows the appearance of partial charges in the tight binding Hamiltonian, setting up a similar circularity. However, it doesn't seem to be complete, because in the two atom special case the partial charges do not appear. This is clarified somewhat by considering the "on-site" integrals defined in equation 29, though it's not really clear to me where are they appear in the Hamiltonian. The review also covers chemical potential equalization. Aside from all that though, one of the most interesting observations is that because of the way the repulsive energy is defined, the first-order correction is precisely what I would consider an expectation value of the electronegativity.}

abstract = {To make practical the molecular dynamics simulation of large scale reactive chemical systems (1000s of atoms), we developed ReaxFF, a force field for reactive systems. ReaxFF uses a general relationship between bond distance and bond order on one hand and between bond order and bond energy on the other hand that leads to proper dissociation of bonds to separated atoms. Other valence terms present in the force field (angle and torsion) are defined in terms of the same bond orders so that all these terms go to zero smoothly as bonds break. In addition, ReaxFF has Coulomb and Morse (van der Waals) potentials to describe nonbond interactions between all atoms (no exclusions). These nonbond interactions are shielded at short range so that the Coulomb and van der Waals interactions become constant as Rij → 0. We report here the ReaxFF for hydrocarbons. The parameters were derived from quantum chemical calculations on bond dissociation and reactions of small molecules plus heat of formation and geometry data for a number of stable hydrocarbon compounds. We find that the ReaxFF provides a good description of these data. Generally, the results are of an accuracy similar or better than PM3, while ReaxFF is about 100 times faster. In turn, the PM3 is about 100 times faster than the QC calculations. Thus, with ReaxFF we hope to be able to study complex reactions in hydrocarbons.},
annotate = {The original ReaxFF paper. Energy decomposition in equation one includes Coulomb energy. Definition of the colon term is in equation 13, shows it depends on an estimate of the partial charges. Right after that it says that it depends on EEM, Electron Equilibration Method. It says that it's not the same as electronegativity equalization but to me it looks like a variant that I would not consider a different method. Or more specifically it distinguishes itself from charge equilibration as defined by Rappé and Goddard 1991. Since this force field is widely used, it's worth citing as an example of the importance of partial charge estimation generally and electronegativity equalization in particular in enabling fast calculations.}

This permits an independent calculation of the slope of the curves of energy vs. position of the nuclei, and may thus increase the accuracy, or decrease the labor involved in the calculation of these curves. The force on a nucleus in an atomic system is shown to be just the classical electrostatic force that would be exerted on this nucleus by other nuclei and by the electrons' charge distribution. Qualitative implications of this are discussed.},
  annotate = {Feynman's paper containing the Feynman-Hellman theorem. Shows how to avoid the discrete difference method in differentiating energy with respect to nuclear positions to obtain forces. This is actually analogous to what is achieved by using one of the thermodynamic relations of constrained density functional theory to relate the derivative of energy with respect to an atomic electron population to the magnitude of the imposed potential. I generalized this to include partial charge definitions where the weight function depends on the density, which ends up requiring a expectation using the computed density, but does not require varying electron populations, so it's analogous to Feynman's goal in this paper, at least from the computational perspective. Feynman's perspective was really more conceptual than computational, which suggests the challenge of finding some classical physics here that the quantum mechanics is disguising.}

    abstract = { The computational bottleneck of the extremely fast simplified Tamm-Dancoff approximated (sTDA) time-dependent density functional theory procedure [S. Grimme, J. Chem. Phys. 138, 244104 (2013)] for the computation of electronic spectra for large systems is the determination of the ground state Kohn-Sham orbitals and eigenvalues. This limits such treatments to single structures with a few hundred atoms and hence, e.g., sampling along molecular dynamics trajectories for flexible systems or the calculation of chromophore aggregates is often not possible. The aim of this work is to solve this problem by a specifically designed semi-empirical tight binding (TB) procedure similar to the well established self-consistent-charge density functional TB scheme. The new special purpose method provides orbitals and orbital energies of hybrid density functional character for a subsequent and basically unmodified sTDA procedure. Compared to many previous semi-empirical excited state methods, an advantage of the ansatz is that a general eigenvalue problem in a non-orthogonal, extended atomic orbital basis is solved and therefore correct occupied/virtual orbital energy splittings as well as Rydberg levels are obtained. A key idea for the success of the new model is that the determination of atomic charges (describing an effective electron-electron interaction) and the one-particle spectrum is decoupled and treated by two differently parametrized Hamiltonians/basis sets. The three-diagonalization-step composite procedure can routinely compute broad range electronic spectra (0-8 eV) within minutes of computation time for systems composed of 500-1000 atoms with an accuracy typical of standard time-dependent density functional theory (0.3-0.5 eV average error). An easily extendable parametrization based on coupled-cluster and density functional computed reference data for the elements H–Zn including transition metals is described. The accuracy of the method termed sTDA-xTB is first benchmarked for vertical excitation energies of open- and closed-shell systems in comparison to other semi-empirical methods and applied to exemplary problems in electronic spectroscopy. As side products of the development, a robust and efficient valence electron TB method for the accurate determination of atomic charges as well as a more accurate calculation scheme of dipole rotatory strengths within the Tamm-Dancoff approximation is proposed. },

doi = {10.26434/chemrxiv.8326202},
abstract = {We propose a semiempirical quantum chemical method, designed for the fast calculation of molecular Geometries, vibrational Frequencies and Non-covalent interaction energies (GFN) of systems with up to a few thousand atoms. Like its predecessors GFN-xTB and GFN2-xTB, the new method termed GFN0-xTB is parameterized for all elements up to radon (Z = 86) and mostly shares well-known density functional tight-binding approximations as well as basis set and integral approximations. The main new feature is the avoidance of the self-consistent charge iterations leading to speed-ups of a factor of 2-20 depending on the size and electronic complexity of the system. This is achieved by including only quantum mechanical contributions up to first-order which are incorporated similar to the previous versions without any pair-specific parameterization. The essential electrostatic electronic interaction is treated by a classical electronegativity equilibration charge model yielding atomic partial charges that enter the electronic Hamiltonian indirectly. Furthermore, the atomic charge-dependent D4 dispersion correction is included to account for long range London correlation effects. Formulas for analytical total energy gradients with respect to nuclear displacements are derived and implemented in the xtb code allowing numerically very precise structure optimizations. The neglect of self-consistent energy terms not only leads to a large gain in computational speed but also can increase robustness in electronically difficult situations because ill-convergence or artificial charge-transfer (CT) is avoided. The comparison of GFN0-xTB and GFN/GFN2-xTB allows dissection of quantum electronic polarization and CT effects thereby improving our understanding of chemical bonding. Compared to the most sophisticated multipole-based GFN2-xTB model (which approaches DFT accuracy for the target properties closely), GFN0-xTB performs slightly worse for non-covalent interactions and molecular structures, while very good results are observed for conformational energies. Vibrational frequencies are obtained less accurately than with GFN/GFN2-xTB but they may still be useful for various purposes like estimating relative thermostatistical reaction energies. Most exceptional is the fact that even relatively complicated transition metal complex structures can be accurately optimized with a non-self-consistent quantum approach. The new method bridges the gap between force-fields and traditional semiempirical methods with its excellent computational cost to accuracy ratio and is intended to explore the chemical space of large molecular systems and solids.},
