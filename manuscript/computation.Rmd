## Computational methods

Binary materials were constructed from pairs of a formal cation and a formal anion from periods 2 to 4.
Each material consisted of a formal cation from group III (starting with boron) and a formal anion from group V (starting with nitrogen).
Geometries were generated in the zincblende crystal structure, optimized in VASP [@vasp] with the PBE functional and PAW pseudopotentials.
These geometries are among those included in a previous study [@discretePeriodicTable].

Then, for each structure, an initial simulation, followed by a sequence of simulations ("frames") with increasing field strengths were performed in CP2K [@cp2k], with the PBE functional, GTH-PBE pseudopotentials, the DZVP-MOLOPT-SR-GTH basis, and 7 Monkhorst–Pack k-points.
For each frame, primitive Hirshfeld-I charges and weight functions were computed as defined in the theory section, and the weight functions were saved as samples on a grid in the Gaussian CUBE format.
These CUBE files containing the weight functions were used to define the shape of the potential used in the next frame.

For each frame, $\energyNuc$ was computed by evaluating energy from the restart file but without the potential.

To compute electronegativity differences using the relationship with field strength, the correction factor was computed by numerical integration, using the electron density sampled on a discrete grid and the derivative of the weight function evaluated on the same grid, using the neutral proatom densities evaluated on that grid and the analytical formula for the weight function derivative.

Training the QEq model with least squares linear regression was done using the \texttt{lm} function in the \texttt{stats} package of R.
