## Functional derivative of energy

We will probe electronegativity by imposing an external electric field that adds a potential $\imposedPotential$.
Let $\energyTot$ be the energy of the ground state in this potential.
It is stationary with respect to variations in the density:

\begin{equation}
  \funcDerivValue{\energyTot}{\electronDensity} = \mu
  (\#eq:StationaryCondition)
\end{equation}

where $\mu$ is the chemical potential.
Let $\energyNuc$ be the energy of the same state, but considering only the potential of the nuclei.
Then,

\begin{equation}
  \funcDerivValue{\energyTot}{\electronDensity}
    = \funcDerivValue{\energyNuc}{\electronDensity} + \imposedPotentialValue
  (\#eq:EnergySplit)
\end{equation}

Combining Equations \@ref(eq:StationaryCondition) and \@ref(eq:EnergySplit) yields a relationship between the functional derivative of $E_{nuc}$ and the imposed potential:

\begin{equation}
  \funcDerivValue{\energyNuc}{\electronDensity}
    = \mu - \imposedPotentialValue
  (\#eq:RelateNucPotential)
\end{equation}

The negative of $\funcDerivValue{\energyNuc}{\electronDensity}$ is like an electronegativity of a point in space.

## Definition of atomic electronegativity

To transition to considering individual atoms, we will begin with a definition of the electron population $N_k$ of atom $k$ in terms of a weight function $w_k(\position)$:

\begin{equation}
  N_k = \spaceIntegral{w_k(\position) \electronDensityValue}
  (\#eq:AtomicPopulation)
\end{equation}

Following the approach of conceptual density functional theory, the electronegativity of an atom will be defined in terms of the chemical potential.
The chemical potential of an atom will be defined the derivative of the energy of the system (considering only the potential of the nuclei) with respect to the electron population of that atom, while holding the electron populations of all other atoms constant:

\begin{equation}
  \mu_k
    = \constDeriv{\energyNuc}{N_k}{N_1,\cdots,N_{k-1},N_{k+1},\cdots}
  (\#eq:ChemicalPotentialDef)
\end{equation}

Atomic electronegativity is $\chi_k = - \mu_k$.

## Measuring atomic electronegativity by imposing a potential

In order to obtain a relationship between the atomic chemical potential and the imposed potential analogous to Equation \@ref(eq:RelateNucPotential), we will also require that the imposed potential has a shape defined by the weight functions:

\begin{equation}
  \imposedPotentialValue
    = \sum_{k} \lambda_k w_k(\position)
  (\#eq:ImposedPotential)
\end{equation}

Then, considering a change in energy $d\energyNuc$ associated with a density variation $\delta\electronDensityValue$:

\begin{equation}
  d\energyNuc
    = \spaceIntegral{\funcDerivValue{\energyNuc}{\electronDensity} \delta\electronDensityValue}
  (\#eq:EnergyNucVariation)
\end{equation}

Substituting, we obtain the total differential:

\begin{equation}
  d\energyNuc
    = \mu dN
      + \sum_{k}(-\lambda_k) \popChangeFixed{k}
  (\#eq:ThermoRelationConstant)
\end{equation}

where $\popChangeFixed{k}$ is the change in electron population of atom $k$ while holding the weight function fixed:

\begin{equation}
  \popChangeFixed{k}
    = \spaceIntegral{w_k(\position) \delta\electronDensityValue}
  (\#eq:PopChangeFixedK)
\end{equation}

This is all that is required for a constant weight function, and is typically referred to as a "thermodynamic relation" in the context of constrained DFT [@KadukConstrainedDFTReview].

To use Hirshfeld-I charges, it is necessary to consider an important complication that arises when the weight function depends on the density itself.
In this case, the change in electron population $\popChange{k}$ the change due to electron flow, plus a term representing the change in partition:

\begin{equation}
  \popChange{k}
    = \spaceIntegral{w_k(\position)\delta\electronDensityValue}
      + \spaceIntegral{\delta w_k(\position)\electronDensityValue}
  (\#eq:PopChangeFullK)
\end{equation}

Since

\begin{equation}
  \delta w_k(\position)
    = \partDeriv{w_k}{N_k}(\position)\popChange{k}
  (\#eq:DeltaWk)
\end{equation}

and using the definition of $\popChangeFixed{k}$ (Equation \@ref(eq:PopChangeFixedK)), we can express the change in electron population as:

\begin{equation}
  \popChange{k}
    = \popChange{k} \spaceIntegral{\partDeriv{w_k}{N_k}(\position)\electronDensityValue}
      + \popChangeFixed{k}
  (\#eq:PopChangeSum)
\end{equation}

Rearranging yields a derivative which is required for expressing the atomic electronegativity when the weight function depends on the electron population:

\begin{equation}
  \correctionFactorPop{k}
    = 1
      - \spaceIntegral{\partDeriv{w_k(\position)}{N_k}\electronDensityValue}
  (\#eq:PopCorrFactor)
\end{equation}

Importantly, this derivative just involves an integral against the density, and therefore can be computed from simulation output.

For a weight function that depends on the density:

\begin{equation}
  d\energyNuc
    = \mu dN
      + \sum_{k}(-\lambda_k) \correctionFactorPop{k} \popChange{k}
  (\#eq:ThermoRelationDensity)
\end{equation}

Since an increase to the electron population of a single atom while holding the others constant increases the total, the atomic chemical potential as defined in Equation \@ref(eq:ChemicalPotentialDef) must include two terms of this total differential:

\begin{equation}
  \mu_k
    = \mu
      - \lambda_k \correctionFactorPop{k}
  (\#eq:MuK)
\end{equation}

This can be regarded as an atom-condensed analogue of Equation \@ref(eq:RelateNucPotential).
