# Introduction

<!-- 1. Identify the problem: what to include in a dataset? / We can include electronegativity in datasets -->
For atomistic simulations, researchers have had to choose between _ab initio_ methods, which have high computational cost but also high accuracy, and force fields, which sacrifice accuracy for speed.
In the last decade, machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have promised to approach DFT accuracy at speeds comparable to traditional force fields, but first must be trained on large datasets generated using _ab initio_ methods such as density functional theory (DFT) [@MILPReview2025].
In the past few years, datasets of the scale required for machine learning, including distorted structures annotated with force for each atom, have been released for both molecules [@comp6,@isayevani2,@omol25] and crystal structures [@chgnet,@omat24].
It is therefore timely to ask how to best construct datasets like these.

Another potentially important property besides force is partial charge.
In both polarizable force fields [@polarizableFFReviewJing] and some MLIPs [@Anstine2023], energy is partitioned into a short-range component and a long-range electrostatic component, and the electrostatic component is computed using charges predicted from the geometry.
In traditional force fields, charge is typically predicted using  charge equilibration (QEq) [@rappe1991charge], and the idea has been revived in "fourth-generation" MLIPs [@fourGenerations].

Some datasets also include the charges of each atom [@comp6,@omol25].
Interestingly, training of QEq models has sometimes included systems perturbed by potentials such as the electrical potential from a nearby point charge [@verstraelenElectronegativityParameters,@verstraelenSilicatesResponse].
ML-scale datasets do not currently include such perturbations, implicitly relying on changes in chemical environment to probe the polarizability of groups.

Our purpose in this work will be to propose not only the inclusion of perturbing potentials in MLIP training datasets, but to annotate these perturbed systems with an additional atomic property, associated with perturbed charges just as a force is associated with an off-equilibrium nuclear position.
To explain this it helps to begin with the theoretical foundation of QEq.

<!-- 2. Conceptual DFT / Electronegativity is a real thing -->
Charge prediction with QEq is based on a theoretical foundation in conceptual DFT, in which concepts of chemistry are defined in terms of concepts from DFT [@geerlingsconceptualDFTreview].
Conceptual DFT began with a new definition of the electronegativity of a molecule or material: the negative of the chemical potential of the electrons in the system [@parrcdftelectronegativity].

Defined this way, the electronegativity $\chi(q)$ is an increasing function of charge $q$, and can be associated with any system, not just a neutral atom but also an ion, a molecule, or a material.
For example, the fluorine atom is very electronegative (high $\chi(0)$), but the fluorine anion less so (smaller $\chi(-1)$).
The familiar concept of an electronegativity associated with an element is recovered by considering the electronegativity $\chi(0)$ of a neutral atom, which (ignoring technicalities) turns out to be the Mulliken electronegativity [@originalMulliken].

QEq requires defining not only the electronegativity $\chi$ of a system, but also the electronegativity $\chi_k$ of an atom $k$ within the system [@conceptualDFTElectronegativityOriginal].
The theoretical basis of QEq is that in the ground state, every atom has the same electronegativity.
For example, while a neutral chlorine atom is more electronegative than a neutral hydrogen atom, in hydrogen chloride, the negative chlorine and the positive hydrogen have equal electronegativities.

QEq methods predict charge by electronegativity equalization: that is, solving for the atomic charges $\vect{q}$ such that all atomic electronegativities $\chi_k(\vect{q})$ are equal, under a constraint on total charge.


<!-- 5. q-prediction and partial charge / We currently only do q-prediction, but... -->
<!-- 6. χ-prediction / We should be doing χ-prediction instead -->
The ultimate purpose of a QEq model is predicting the charges $q_k$, which we will call the $q$-prediction task.
It is an empirical model which must be trained to reproduce data.
While the training target has sometimes been system-level observables such as dipole moments [@chemicalPotentialEqualization], it can also be trained directly in the $q$-prediction task using $q_k$ values extracted from DFT [@verstraelenElectronegativityParameters].
But its physical basis is the assumption of a linear model for what we call the $\chi$-prediction task: the prediction of $\chi_k$ given each $q_k$ as input.

<!-- Analogy to force / If force prediction is easier, probably so is χ-prediction -->
In this work, we will raise a new possibility: using a dataset that includes not only atomic charges $q_k$ extracted from DFT but atomic electronegativities $\chi_k$ as well.
Then, we can train the QEq model by minimizing error in prediction of the atomic electronegativities $\chi_k$, which we call the $\chi$-prediction task.
Once the QEq model is trained to the $\chi$-prediction task, it can then be used for $q$-prediction through electronegativity equalization.

The advantage of training with $\chi$-prediction is suggested by analogy to another prediction task, prediction of equilibrium geometries.
The equilibrium geometry of a molecule or material is usually predicted by solving for the geometry at which forces are zero.
Like force, $\chi_k$ is a derivative of energy.
Electronegativity equalization, then, is analogous to prediction of a geometry by solving for zero forces.

The distinction between predicting geometry directly, and indirectly by way of force, can be illustrated with the machine learning tasks in the Open Catalyst Project OCP challenge.
OCP ranks models on "direct" prediction of a relaxed geometry from an initial geometry, as well as a separate task in which a model predicts forces [@kolluru2022openchallengesdevelopinggeneralizable].
The use of the force model to solve for the equilibrium geometry is then called "indirect" prediction.
Electronegativity equalization, then, is indirect prediction of charge in the same sense.

<!-- Training on the χ-prediction task is feasible because you can get the data -->
For the first time, we use $\chi_k$ values as a prediction target to train a charge equilibration model.
By means of a complete execution of training a simple QEq model in the $\chi$-prediction problem, we will show that all issues that emerge are solvable.
We train a QEq model by least squares regression in the $\chi$-prediction problem, and then predict charge by electronegativity equalization.

For this demonstration, we constructed a minimal example of a dataset for the $\chi$-prediction problem, consisting of crystal structures of binary materials.
This dataset keeps the demonstration simple by only treating crystal structures with two atoms in the unit cell.
<!-- Issue: do two-atom molecules really have incomplete valence shells? How to describe what's so weird about carbon monoxide? Or, more to the point, diatomic boron nitride? -->
By examining crystal structures instead of molecules, we avoid the incomplete valence shells found in two-atom molecules.
