# Introduction

Estimation of partial charge of atoms is an important subtask in fast computational methods for simulating molecules and crystals.
The electronegativity equalization method (EEq) provides fast estimates of atomic charges which are used routinely in polarizable force fields, and have been proposed as a means of avoiding iteration in tight binding [@gfn0xtb].
EEq is founded in conceptual density functional theory, in which the electronegativity of an atom has been defined as the negative chemical potential of the atom, which is equal throughout space in the ground state [@parrcdftelectronegativity]
In this framework, EEq follows from a model in which electronegativity of the atom is assumed to depend linearly upon its charge, enabling fast computation by solving a linear system [@conceptualDFTElectronegativityOriginal].

Defining the electronegativity of an atom in terms of its chemical potential suggests an analogy to a force.
Like a force, the chemical potential is a derivative of the energy, but with respect to the atom's electron population.
The electronegativity equalization condition, then, is analogous to the condition that the force is equal at an equilibrium geometry.

Applying the method requires first estimating its parameters, which is accomplished by minimizing the difference between predicted charges and charges computed from first principles simulations [@verstraelenElectronegativityParameters].
The analogy between atomic electronegativities and forces suggests an alternative approach to parameter fitting, in which we consider the model as a mapping from a vector of atomic charges to a vector of atomic electronegativities.
Then, parameters are fitted to minimize the discrepancy between predicted and ground truth atomic electronegativity, using a training dataset that includes "non-equilibrium" solutions for each structure.
Creating such a dataset from first-principles simulations requires definitions of atomic charges and atomic electronegativity, as well as a means to simulate the required non-equilibrium solutions.
Simulations of a given system with alternative atomic charges are achievable with constrained density functional theory [@PhysRevA.72.024502], but this has not been used to create a training dataset for parameter fitting.

We bring together the theory of electronegativity equalization with the theory of constrained density functional theory to create a training set for a model mapping charge to electronegativity.
As a proof of principle, we fit the simplest possible model, a linear model, which in this framing is identical to EEq.
