# Introduction

Molecules and materials are made of atoms, and the electron density is, to a rough approximation, composed of spherically symmetric atomic densities.
In this picture, each atom is describable by a single number, the electron population or partial charge of the atom.
This picture of spherically symmetric atoms underlies the monopole approximation, often used in fast computational models such as force fields or tight binding models.
Such drastic approximations are necessary to scale calculations to large molecules like proteins or the millions of candidate materials considered for a virtual screen.
The importance of the assignment of partial charges in these applications motivates the study of predictive models of charge.

Fast predictive models do not compute the result from quantum mechanical first principles, and instead contain arbitrary free parameters.
Whether it's dozens of parameters of a classical empirical method or billions of parameters of a modern machine learning model, these parameters are fit by minimizing a loss function, such as error in charge prediction.
While this may seem inevitable since the ultimate purpose of the model is to predict charges, it is interesting to contrast this with another task: prediction of equilibrium geometries.

The equilibrium geometry of a molecule or material is usually predicted using a force model, by solving for the geometry at which forces are zero.
To suggest an analogous procedure for charge prediction, consider that the force is the negative derivative of energy with respect to nuclear position.
If we instead take the derivative with respect to the electron population of the atom, what we have is the definition of electronegativity used in conceptual density functional theory [@conceptualDFTElectronegativityOriginal].
This suggests an alternative procedure for predicting charge: using a model that maps charges of atoms ($q$) to their electronegativities ($\chi$), solve for $q$ such that all $\chi$ are equal.

We will refer to direct prediction of partial charges as $q$-prediction; a $q$-prediction model takes a geometry as input, and outputs a prediction of charges.
In contrast, a electronegativity prediction ($\chi$-prediction) model takes geometry and charge as input, and outputs $\chi$, the predicted electronegativities.
Our main suggestion will be to train models by minimizing $\chi$-prediction loss, even though the model will ultimately be applied for $q$-prediction.

Training on the $\chi$-prediction task requires a dataset with paired atomic charges and atomic electronegativities, including for "non-equilibrium" electron densities with unequal electronegativities.
In this work we will demonstrate how to construct such a dataset by applying potentials to individual atoms.
The strength of this potential is precisely the electronegativity of the atom.

To demonstrate fitting a model to the $\chi$-prediction task, we will fit the simplest possible predictive model, the linear model.
We also show that a linear $\chi$-prediction model yields a parametrization of the classical electronegativity equalization (EEq) method [@rappe1991charge].
The use of arbitrary $\chi$-prediction models for charge prediction could then be regarded as generalized electronegativity equalization.
