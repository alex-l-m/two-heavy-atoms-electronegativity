# Introduction

<!-- 1. Identify the problem: what to include in a dataset? / We can include electronegativity in datasets -->
For atomistic simulations, researchers have had to choose between _ab initio_ methods, which are accurate but have high computational cost, and force fields, which sacrifice accuracy for speed.
In the last decade, machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have promised to approach DFT accuracy at speeds comparable to traditional force fields, but first must be trained on large datasets generated using _ab initio_ methods such as density functional theory (DFT) [@MILPReview2025].
In the past few years, datasets of the scale required for machine learning, containing off-equilibrium geometries annotated with force for each atom, have been released for both molecules [@comp6,@isayevani2,@omol25] and crystal structures [@chgnet,@omat24].
It is therefore timely to ask how to best construct datasets like these.

Besides force, another important atomic property included in some datasets [@comp6,@omol25] is partial charge.
In both polarizable force fields [@polarizableFFReviewJing] and some MLIPs [@Anstine2023], energy is partitioned into a short-range component and a long-range electrostatic component, and this electrostatic component is computed using charges predicted from the geometry.
In traditional force fields, charge is typically predicted using  charge equilibration (QEq) [@rappe1991charge], and the idea has been revived in "fourth-generation" MLIPs [@fourGenerations].

Although charge models such as QEq can be trained on system-level observables such as dipole moments [@chemicalPotentialEqualization], when training data are annotated with charge, the models can be trained by minimizing error in charge prediction [@verstraelenElectronegativityParameters].

Interestingly, training of QEq models has sometimes included systems perturbed by potentials such as the electrical potential from a nearby point charge [@verstraelenElectronegativityParameters,@verstraelenSilicatesResponse].
ML-scale training datasets do not currently include such perturbations.

Using external potentials to augment ML training datasets with distorted electron densities could help models generalize to chemical environments not directly present in the training data.
However, our purpose in this work is to propose going farther, and annotating atoms with an atomic property associated with a distorted electron density just as force is associated with a distorted geometry.

<!-- 2. Conceptual DFT / Electronegativity is a real thing -->
This property is electronegativity, as defined in conceptual DFT [@geerlingsconceptualDFTreview].
Conceptual DFT began with a new definition of the electronegativity of a system: the negative of the chemical potential of the electrons [@parrcdftelectronegativity].
Defined this way, the electronegativity $\chi(q)$ is an increasing function of charge $q$, and can be associated with any system, not just a neutral atom but also an ion, a molecule, or a material.
For example, the fluorine atom is very electronegative (high $\chi(0)$), but the fluorine anion less so (smaller $\chi(-1)$).
This charge-dependent electronegativity departs from the traditional concept in which electronegativity is a property of an element, but considering the electronegativity $\chi(0)$ of a neutral atom recovers the familiar Mulliken electronegativity.

Defining not only the electronegativity $\chi$ of a system, but also the electronegativity $\chi_k$ of an atom $k$ within the system [@conceptualDFTElectronegativityOriginal], provides the foundation for charge prediction with QEq.
QEq methods predict charge by electronegativity equalization: that is, solving for the atomic charges $\vect{q}$ such that all atomic electronegativities $\chi_k(\vect{q})$ are equal, under a constraint on total charge.
For example, a neutral chlorine atom is more electronegative than a neutral hydrogen atom, but after combining to form hydrogen chloride, the negative chlorine and the positive hydrogen have equal electronegativities.

<!-- Analogy to force -->
The electronegativity equalization condition is analogous to the condition that equilibrium geometries have zero force, since like force, $\chi_k$ is a derivative of energy.
This seems to imply that electronegativity is not an interesting atomic property, since it is the same for all atoms in a system.
However, as we will explain, systems with an external potential imposed can be regarded as having non-equalized electronegativities.
From this perspective, such systems have off-equilibrium electron densities, analogous to the off-equilibrium geometries currently included in MLIP training data.

<!-- 5. q-prediction and partial charge / We currently only do q-prediction, but... -->
<!-- 6. χ-prediction / We should be doing χ-prediction instead -->
We show that, like force, atomic electronegativity $\chi_k$ can be used as a prediction target for training models.
To this end, we fully execute a simple demonstration: training a QEq model on a dataset of binary materials.
We train in what we call the "$\chi$-prediction problem", using the model to predict $\chi_k$ for each atom, and minimizing the error of these predictions on the training dataset.
Although QEq has a natural framing as a linear model for $\chi_k$, our study is the first time it has ever been trained using a dataset of $\chi_k$ values.
Once the parameters of the QEq model have been obtained in the $\chi$-prediction problem, we use the resulting model for charge prediction (the $q$-prediction problem) by equalizing electronegativity.
