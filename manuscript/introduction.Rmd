# Introduction

<!-- 1. Identify the problem: what to include in a dataset? / We can include electronegativity in datasets -->
Atomistic simulation has long involved a trade-off: *ab initio* methods are accurate but computationally expensive, while force fields sacrifice accuracy for speed.
Over the past decade, machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have aimed to approach _ab initio_ accuracy with force-field efficiency, but training them requires large datasets generated from *ab initio* calculations [@MILPReview2025].
In the past few years, datasets of the scale required for machine learning, containing off-equilibrium geometries annotated with force for each atom, have been released for both molecules [@comp6,@isayevani2,@omol25] and crystal structures [@chgnet,@omat24].
It is therefore timely to ask what information such datasets should include.

Besides force, another important atomic property included in some datasets [@comp6,@omol25] is partial charge.
Partial charges are used to compute the electrostatic component of energy in some traditional force fields [@polarizableFFReviewJing] and MLIPs [@Anstine2023].
In traditional polarizable force fields, charge is typically predicted using charge equilibration (QEq) [@rappe1991charge], and the idea has been revived in "fourth-generation" MLIPs [@fourGenerations].

Although QEq models can be trained using system-level observables such as dipole moments [@chemicalPotentialEqualization], the availability of per-atom charge annotations enables a more direct strategy: training the model by minimizing errors in the predicted charges themselves [@verstraelenElectronegativityParameters].
Interestingly, some QEq has been trained on data including systems subjected to external perturbations, such as the electrostatic potential created by a nearby point charge, to probe how charges respond [@verstraelenElectronegativityParameters; @verstraelenSilicatesResponse].

ML-scale training datasets do not currently include this kind of externally perturbed system.
Using external potentials to augment ML training datasets with distorted electron densities could help models generalize to chemical environments not directly present in the training data, or help with QM/MM applications [@polarizableQMMM].

<!-- 2. Conceptual DFT / Electronegativity is a real thing -->
The possibility we will explore in this work is not just distorting electron densities via external potentials, but annotating the data with a new atomic property, associated with distorted densities just as force is associated with distorted geometries.
This property is electronegativity, as defined in conceptual density functional theory (DFT) [@geerlingsconceptualDFTreview].

Conceptual DFT began with a new definition of the electronegativity of a system: the negative of the chemical potential of the electrons [@parrcdftelectronegativity].
Defined this way, the electronegativity $\chi(q)$ is an increasing function of charge $q$, and can be associated with any system, not just a neutral atom but also an ion, a molecule, or a material.
For example, the fluorine atom is very electronegative (high $\chi(0)$), but the fluoride anion less so (smaller $\chi(-1)$).
This charge-dependent concept departs from the traditional concept in which electronegativity is a property of an element, but recovers the familiar Mulliken electronegativity from $\chi(0)$ of a neutral atom.

Defining not only the electronegativity $\chi$ of a system, but also the electronegativity $\chi_k$ of an atom $k$ within the system [@conceptualDFTElectronegativityOriginal], provides the foundation for charge prediction with QEq.
QEq methods predict atomic charges $\vect{q}$ by electronegativity equalization: solving $\chi_k(\vect{q})=\chi$ under a constraint on total charge.
For example, a neutral chlorine atom is more electronegative than a neutral hydrogen atom, but after combining to form hydrogen chloride, the negative chlorine and the positive hydrogen have equal electronegativities.

<!-- Analogy to force -->
The electronegativity equalization condition is analogous to the condition that equilibrium geometries have zero force, since like force, $\chi_k$ is a derivative of energy.
This seems to imply that electronegativity is not an interesting atomic property, since at equilibrium all $\chi_k$ are equal.
However, as we will explain, systems with an external potential imposed can be regarded as having non-equalized electronegativities.
From this perspective, such systems have off-equilibrium electron densities, analogous to the off-equilibrium geometries currently included in MLIP training data.

<!-- 5. q-prediction and partial charge / We currently only do q-prediction, but... -->
<!-- 6. χ-prediction / We should be doing χ-prediction instead -->
Like force, atomic electronegativity $\chi_k$ can be used as a prediction target when training models.
To demonstrate this, we train a QEq model on a dataset of binary materials, determining its parameters by minimizing the error in predicting $\chi_k$.
Although QEq has a natural framing as a linear model for this $\chi$-prediction task, our study is the first to train a QEq model on electronegativities, rather than charges, extracted from DFT.
After training, we use the resulting model for charge prediction (the $q$-prediction task) by equalizing electronegativity.
