# Abstract
<!-- Basic introduction -->
In atomistic simulation, _ab initio_ methods are accurate but too computationally expensive for large systems, long trajectories, or high-throughput screening.
<!-- More detailed background -->
Machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are approaching the accuracy of _ab initio_ methods at speeds closer to traditional force fields by training on large datasets of _ab initio_ results.
These training datasets contain off-equilibrium geometries labeled with the force on each atom, and, in some datasets, atomic partial charges.
<!-- General problem addressed -->
<!-- Project concept in a sentence -->
We propose adding diversity to the training data by perturbing atomic charge, and annotating atoms with a corresponding additional label: electronegativity, as defined in conceptual density functional theory.
<!-- Summary of new results for specialists -->
To demonstrate this proposal, we construct a training dataset of crystals with two-atom unit cells, controlling the charge transfer between the atoms by imposing an external potential.
By matching the form of the potential to the charge partitioning scheme, we computed the electronegativity difference from the strength of the imposed potential.
Fitting these electronegativity differences with linear regression yields the parameters of a charge equilibration model.
<!-- Statement of impact to specialists -->
Our results demonstrate a new way of training the charge assignment models which are incorporated into some MLIPs, and show how to diveristy MLIP training datasets while simultaneously adding atom-level response properties that can be used as training targets.
