# Abstract
<!-- Basic introduction -->
Drug discovery and materials discovery rely on atomistic simulations of larger systems, longer timescales, and larger numbers of systems than is feasible with _ab initio_ computational chemistry.
<!-- More detailed background -->
Recently, machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have approached the accuracy of _ab initio_ methods at speeds closer to traditional force fields.
MLIPs are trained using large datasets of _ab initio_ simulations.
These training datasets contain off-equilibrium geometries labelled with a force for each atom, and sometimes atomic charge.
<!-- General problem addressed -->
<!-- Project concept in a sentence -->
We propose adding diversity to the training data by perturbing atomic charge, and annotating atoms with a corresponding additional label: electronegativity, as defined in conceptual density functional theory.
<!-- Summary of new results for specialists -->
As a demonstration, we created a training dataset consisting of crystals with two-atom unit cells, with the charge transfer between the atoms controlled by an external potential.
By matching the form of the potential to the charge definition, we computed the electronegativity difference from the strength of the potenial.
Training a linear model for the electronegativity difference yielded the parameters of a charge equilibration model as weights.
<!-- Statement of impact to specialists -->
Our results demonstrate a new way of training the charge assignment models which are incorporated into some MLIPs.
Furthermore, we show a path towards increasing the diversity of MLIP training datasets while simultaneously enriching the atomic descriptors that can be used as training targets.
