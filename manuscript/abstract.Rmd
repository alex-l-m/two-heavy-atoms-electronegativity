# Abstract

Force fields, including machine learning force fields, often divide the energy into a short-range component and an electrostatic component, and approximate the electrostatic component by assigning partial charges to each atom.
Partial charges are often predicted using charge equilibration (QEq), and QEq models are often trained by minimizing error in charge prediction (the $q$-prediction problem).
In this work we raise a new possibility: using a dataset that includes not only atomic charges $q_k$ extracted from DFT but atomic electronegativities $\chi_k$ as well, and training the QEq model by minimizing error in prediction of the atomic electronegativities $\chi_k$.
We call this the $\chi$-prediction problem.
Once the QEq model is trained in the $\chi$-prediction task, it can then be used for $q$-prediction through electronegativity equalization.
The advantage of training with $\chi$-prediction is suggested by analogy to another prediction task, prediction of equilibrium geometries, with $\chi_k$ analogous to a force.
We have demonstrated this new approach by annotating a training dataset with first-principles atomic electronegativities, and training a charge prediction model in the $\chi$-prediction problem.
We then obtain predictions of charge using this model.
Our simple demonstration opens a new direction in training charge models, in which the model learns a generalized force on a charge.
