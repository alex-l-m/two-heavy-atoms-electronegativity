In a set of binary crystals, a series of DFT simulations were performed, imposing successively larger electrical potentials, negative at the cation and positive at the anion (Figure \@ref(fig:my-figure)A).
At each step, charges $q_A$ and $q_D$ were computed using the Hirshfeld-I method, and the energy the system was recomputed in the absence of the imposed potential to obtain $\energyNuc$ (Figure \@ref(fig:my-figure)B).
The potential at each step was defined in terms of the weight functions $w_A(r)$ and $w_D(r)$ obtained from the Hirshfeld-I analysis:

$$\imposedPotentialValue = \lambda (w_A(r) - w_D(r))$$

Defining the electronegativity of an atom as the negative of its chemical potential, the difference in electronnegativities between the two atoms is the derivative of this energy curve:
$$\Delta \chi = \chi_A - \chi_D = \constDeriv{\energyNuc}{q_A}{N}$$
This can be obtained by numerical differentiation.
However, as a consequence of the form of the potential (reference formula here), the derivative can also be obtained from the strength of the field:
$$\constDeriv{\energyNuc}{q_D}{N} = 2 \correctionFactorPop{A} \lambda$$
where $\correctionFactorPop{A}$ corrects for the shift in the boundary between the atoms.
The two methods for obtaining the electronegativity difference match closely( Figure \@ref(fig:my-figure)C)

The DFT simulations were used to train a model from charges to eelctronegativities.
Any such model corresponds to a function mapping a vector of atomic charges $\vect{q}$ to a vector of atomic electronegativities $\vect{\chi}(\vect{q})$.
During training, a model $\vect{\chi}(\vect{q})$ must reproduce the relationship between charge and electronegativity observed in the simulations.
For the binary materials, the trend is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:my-figure)D.
The simplest choice of model for $\vect{\chi}(\vect{q})$ is a linear model.
This \emph{ansatz} is equivalent to the classical electronegativity equalization method (EEq),The parameter estimates will differ due to the different loss function.
For two atoms and for fixed total charge, the model can be simplified to
$$\chi_A - \chi_D = (\chi_A^0 - \chi_D^0) + (\eta_A + \eta_D - 2 c_{AD}) q_{AD}$$
where $q_A$ is the charge of the acceptor atom, $\chi_A^0$ and $\chi_D^0$ are the electronegativities of the acceptor and donor atoms when neutral, $\eta_A$ and $\eta_D$ are hardnesses, and $c_{AD}$ is an interaction parameter.
Fitting this model using a standard linear regression package results in $\chi^0_A$ parameters that reproduce familiar trends in electronegativity (Figure \@ref(fig:my-figure)E).
