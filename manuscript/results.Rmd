To fit a $\chi$-prediction model, a training dataset is required that contains both $q$ and $\chi$ for each atom.
We construct a minimal example of such a dataset, consisting of binary materials, specifically 3-5 zincblendes, a class of semiconductor materials that includes the solar cell material gallium arsenide and the LED material gallium nitride.

Materials were simulated with DFT to obtain both energy and atomic charge, computed with the Hirshfeld-I method.
An electrical potential was applied that was positive at the donor atom and negative at the acceptor, to draw electron density back to the donor (Figure \@ref(fig:dataset-illustration-figure)A).
The potential was of the form
\begin{equation}
  \imposedPotentialValue = \lambda \bigl(w_A(r) - w_D(r)\bigr)
  (\#eq:ImposedPotentialTwoAtom)
\end{equation}
where \(w_A(r)\) and \(w_D(r)\) are the weight functions defining the boundaries of the atoms, obtained from the Hirshfeld-I analysis.
For each material, a series of simulations was performed with successively stronger potentials until both atoms were neutral.
In each of these frames of the series, the weight functions from the previous frame were used to define the potential according to Equation \eqref{eq:ImposedPotentialTwoAtom}.

The energy at each frame $\energyNuc$ tended to be approximately quadratic as a function of charge, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:dataset-illustration-figure)B for gallium phosphide.
The electronegativity difference is the derivative of this curve:
\begin{equation}
  \Delta \chi = \chi_A - \chi_D = \constDeriv{\energyNuc}{q_A}{N}
  (\#eq:DeltaChi)
\end{equation}
$\Delta \chi$ can be obtained numerically by discrete differences, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:dataset-illustration-figure)C.

$\Delta \chi$ can also be obtained from each frame individually without taking differences, due to the form of the imposed potential in equation \eqref{eq:ImposedPotentialTwoAtom}.
If the Hirshfeld-I weight functions were constant between the frames, $\Delta \chi$ would simply be $2 \lambda$, and the electronegativity difference could be read off from the input settings of the simulations without even looking at the output.
Since the boundary between the atoms is shifting, an extra factor is required:
\begin{equation}
  \constDeriv{\energyNuc}{q_A}{N} = 2 \correctionFactorPop{A} \lambda
  (\#eq:DerivativePotential)
\end{equation}
Since the factor $\correctionFactorPop{A}$ can be computed as an integral against the electron density, $\Delta \chi$ can still be obtained from a single frame without numerical differentiation.
The two methods for obtaining the electronegativity difference match closely (Figure \@ref(fig:dataset-illustration-figure)C).
Electronegativity differences for all materials are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:linear-model-figure)A.

The simplest possible model $\chi$-prediction model would be a linear model:
\begin{equation}
  \chi_A - \chi_D
    = \bigl(\chi_A^0 - \chi_D^0\bigr)
      + \bigl(\eta_A + \eta_D - 2\,c_{AD}\bigr)\,q_{A}
  (\#eq:LinearModel)
\end{equation}
This is the _ansatz_ assumed in EEq, and the EEq parameters appear as regression coefficients: electronegativities of the neutral donor atom $\chi_D^0$ and acceptor atom $\chi_A^0$, hardnesses $\eta_D$ and $\eta_A$, and an interaction parameter $c_{AD}$.
The parameters were estimated using least squares linear regression.
As a sanity check, the $\chi^0$ parameters were compared to Pauling electronegativities, with which they correlated closely, except for boron (Figure \@ref(fig:linear-model-figure)B).

The predictive performance of the model was tested using leave-one-out cross-validation.
In each structure, the linear relationship \eqref{eq:LinearModel}, with parameters estimated from the dataset excluding that structure, is shown overlaid on the DFT results in Figure \@ref(fig:linear-model-figure)A.
The y intercept shows the difference in electronegativity when both atoms are neutral, which in the leave-one-out analysis is the difference between the $\chi^0$ parameters for the two elements, estimated from the other structures containing those elements.
The x intercept is the model's estimate of the charge of the acceptor atom.

A formula for the charge estimate can be obtained by setting $\chi_A - \chi_D$ to zero and solving \eqref{eq:LinearModel} for $q_A$:
\begin{equation}
  -q_A = \frac{\chi_A^0 - \chi_D^0}{\eta_A + \eta_D - 2\,c_{AD}}
  (\#eq:EEqPred)
\end{equation}
This is the familiar electronegativity equalization equation.

Estimates of charge in the leave-one-out analysis are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:linear-model-figure)C, and correlated closely with the density functional theory results.
In this way, the $\chi$-prediction model defined by \eqref{eq:LinearModel} was used to solve the $q$-prediction problem, in a manner analogous to the prediction of equilibrium geometry is from a force model.
