Density functional theory (DFT) and Bader atoms-in-molecules (AIM) analysis of systems with two heavy atoms.
Charge transfer in these systems is analyzed with electronegativity, by way of the concept of atomic chemical potential from conceptual DFT.
Determinations of chemical potential by AIM analysis are compared to empirical determinations from electronegativity equalization.
